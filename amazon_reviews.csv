JANICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,This case is not worth the money.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021","I usually have an iphone case for the life of the iPhone. I purchased this silicone case and it started to deteriorate quickly. First the corners start cracking and crumbling. Then other places around the edge start doing the same. I would take a picture, but I‚Äôm afraid if I took it off my phone it would totally disintegrate. Plus the charging magnet is temperamental. I would recommend staying away from this set."
Brandon S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth it,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024","I‚Äôve had dozens of cases throughout the years but this one is probably my favorite. Thin, sleek, comfortable and durable."
Vadym,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2024",Nice touch
tim cadle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Value For This iPhone Case!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023","I was a little hesitant about buying this case considering the price-point, but I figured I‚Äôd give it a try after it went on sale. I am so glad that I did! The fit is absolutely perfect, the texture is perfect for griping but not being too sticky, and it cleans very easily. I got white concrete dust all over my hands, and I had to use my phone, so I got that dust all over the case while I was holding it. It wiped right off with a cloth, none of it stuck to the case, which I thought was very impressive with how sticky that dust can be. I‚Äôve gotten it on tool handles, and other things where it actually stuck to it. So definitely good on the ease of cleaning. Also, if anyone is curious, this case‚Äôs silicone material matches the feel of the silicone on the iPad Magic Keyboard Case, and it also perfectly color matches with the black one. And the magsafe capabilities are awesome! I would highly recommend this case. üëçüèª"
Nancie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this case, it's protected my phone but ...","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2022","This is my second case. I love this case, it's protected my phone, but ... each time the phone is dropped another chunk of silicone breaks or peels off the case. The color is great, the feel is great, not too sticky or slippery, nice feel in my hand, slim. I understand silicone and there is a fine balance between how hard to make it vs look and feel. For me the look and feel of the product when I am carrying it was more important so I bought another one and know it will only last me a year or so."

Kevin S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone Case,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023","Great Phone case! Looks great, feels great, and I got it at a great price. Highly recommend getting a name brand or quality phone case. It makes all the difference"
elyeager,1.0 out of 5 stars,A real heart breaker,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023","I bought this case in January. Let me tell you that I didn't just want to love this case -- I actually loved it. I loved the hand-feel, I loved the mag-safe, I loved the bright color. I convinced my husband and several friends to buy the same silicone case.

Fast forward 9 months and this case is garbage.

First, I dropped my phone once in July. My entire back glass is shattered. Fast forward a few weeks and I started to notice cracking around the edges of the phone. 3 out of 4 corners now have cracked and ripped pieces.

I haven't been especially hard on this phone or case. And I've never had a case respond so poorly to regular use, or need to be replaced in nine months."
Avery Olson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024","It's a pretty good phone case, but I do have a few tings to mention. I was very disappointed as the magnet on the case isn't very strong. I saw complaints about others cases starting to wear really fast and I don't have very much of that yet (I've had it for a few weeks now) and I hope I don't get any wear anytime soon. Paying 50$ for a name brand phone case is insane so I shouldn't experience wear and tear after a month like others complained of."
Maggie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ordering from Amazon is just the greatest way to go.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024",Too bulky for me. Will reorder when I have time

Frank Concord,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great fit,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024",Perfect fit for iPhone 12. A bit sticky for debris on the backside.
Primetime,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2024",Such a good value for a basic iPhone case. It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking forward to having to go to the store.
Helen J. Noel,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wasn‚Äôt sure about the color but it is a beautiful color,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024",Love that fact that it is easy to find when you forget where you left it just the right color nor to red
William Hale,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best iPhone cover!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2023",This silicone cover slips on your phone easily. All buttons work perfectly. And the MagSafe charger actually ‚Äúsnaps ‚Äú into place easily. My Otterbox cover was hard to attach to MagSafe charger. Love this cover.
Rasocus,4.0 out of 5 stars,Feels good in your hands,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023","Nice and smooth but won't last long. Hard to fine for Iphone 12 Pro Max, yeah still working perfectly, swap to OtterBox."
Thomas Sweo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the Case, Could be of Higher Quality","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024",I have purchased this from Apple twice now (in plum) and the edges have peeled on both. These cases look and feel great but don‚Äôt wear very well. Peeling occurred after roughly a year of use.
Becks Behr,5.0 out of 5 stars,O.E.M. Apple quality,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2024",Excellent O.E.M. Apple quality.
"this is good quality and over all worth the money in my opinion. the only con is that lint from jeans or leggings sticks to it it‚Äôs easy to wipe it but it gets kinda annoying sometimes but totally worth it, it keeps me phone pretty safe, the case is pretty thick it‚Äôs self so i think it‚Äôs going to last a long time will be buying again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,it‚Äôs a really good case totally worth it,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023",it‚Äôs pretty thick so i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll keep my phone safe will buy again ( if i need to)
Michael Grubbs,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but falling apart,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2024","I was going to return this case, but I ended up keeping it because I like the feeling and look of the case. The case as a whole isn‚Äôt bad, but mine has started to shed different parts of the edge. It‚Äôs starting to look bad and feel less protective, and it‚Äôs only been a month or 2. If this is rare and only happened to mine, this case would be great! But I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs rare or not."

shelleyeatz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Apple Cases Fit IPhones Best,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2023","No other case fits iPhones better than the apple brand cases. Also the silicone is very grippy, so you‚Äôre less likely to drop your phone. The MagSafe part also works most perfectly"
Sandie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Case,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2023","This is my 2nd Apple case like this and you can‚Äôt beat it!!! Love that it is not slippery, and that it comes in great colors‚Ä¶ quality is amazing and comfortable to hold‚Ä¶"

Marcy Cydan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Does not last,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2023","I like the red; easy to find, and the feel, but the phone constantly pushes corners out of the cover and the cover chips easily. After only a few months it was cracked on one side with small chips out here and there. I am not hard on phones, and while it has protected the phone when its been dropped, I don't like the idea of something being ready to discard so quickly. I thought this was good case, but honestly, it's not my version of durable. It's literally falling apart. For nearly $50 I expected it to last at least a few years; I got less than 14 months of use out of it, and most of that was with chips and cracks in it."
tim,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay‚Ä¶,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2023","Had it for several months then the silicone started to rip off. At first it was a little piece on the corner then more and more. It‚Äôs not to the point where it‚Äôs ripped off completely but it‚Äôs pretty noticeable. A lot of the bottom half sides of the case is missing the silicone. I don‚Äôt even abuse my phone case (taking the case off and switching it or drop my phone with the case).

Now, I switched out for a different case but switch back to this one since it has mag safe and I use that for my car holder. For this price the case should last longer."
Matt,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality case, high-end feel, minimal protection","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2021","I bought the deep navy silicone case for my iphone 12...color is as advertised (great). It's a perfect case for those who want a minimalist case with a quality, high-end feel. My favorite iphone was the 5 because of the squared edges, so I was looking for a slim case with a minimalist feel that allows you to feel the edges. I did not get the leather because I read it was a bit more ""slippery"" than the silicone and wanted a more secure grip. The silicone texture has a soft, fine brushed feel to it which is very pleasing. Protection is average to low, but I believe that is on purpose. You can't have max protection with a slim/minimalist case. The edges of the case barely come over the front screen but the cutouts and buttons are nice. My only complaint is the price, which is quite high. But it's Apple and you're paying for the name and the quality. If you can get past that, you'll certainly be pleased."
Esteban,3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt properly fir,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023","It‚Äôs a nice minimalistic case, problem is it seems that the fit it‚Äôs not good which is a shame been an apple brand accessory. It‚Äôs fits is almost as if my iPhone was swollen in the middle (which it isn‚Äôt), this give me the creeps because in a fall the glass will almost certainly will be hitting th floor"
